	  This driver configures the SDP RVU PF when OcteonTx is in PCIe EndPoint
	  mode. It sets up the SDP rings  and the VFs to be used in packet transfer
	  using the NIX block.

	  To compile this as a module choose M here.

config OCTEONTX2_DPI_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 DPI-DMA PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	default m
	help
	  Select this option to enable DPI PF driver support.
	  DPI (DMA packet interface) provides DMA support for MAC.
	  This driver intializes DPI PF device and enables VFs for supporting
	  different types of DMA transfers.
